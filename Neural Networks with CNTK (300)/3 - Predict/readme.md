In the [previous lab](#), you used Azure Machine Learning Workbench to execute a Python script that converts raw data from the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains 60,000 scanned and normalized images of the hand-written digits 0 through 9, into data that can be used to train neural networks built with the [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/), also known as CNTK. The script ran in a Docker container, received input from Azure blob storage, and wrote its output to Azure blob storage.

In this lab, the third of four in a series, you will return to Machine Learning Workbench and train three machine-learning models that rely on CNTK neural networks. The goal: to find the best model for recognizing hand-written digits with an eye toward operationalizing the model and building a client app that uses it in the next and final lab in this series.
